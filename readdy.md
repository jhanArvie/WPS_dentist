"Create a responsive single-page website template for service-based small businesses that I can customize per business type. When I specify a business category (e.g., massage, salon, restaurant), generate a tailored readdy.ai prompt including:

## Core Template Features:

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Fast-loading vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
- Netlify form integration (pre-configured)
- SEO-ready structure
- Accessible WCAG-compliant markup

## Business-Specific Adaptations:
For each business type I specify, include in the generated prompt:

- Relevant section headers (Services/Menu/Classes)
- Appropriate form fields:
    - Salons: Service selector + appointment times
    - Restaurants: Reservation form + menu display
    - Driving schools: Course schedule + enrollment
- Industry-standard CTAs
- Typical content structure

## Technical Requirements:
- Clean, commented code
- CSS variables for easy theming
- Form validation with user feedback
- Optimized assets (SVG where possible)
- No external dependencies except Google Maps API

## Output Format:
Each generated prompt must provide:

## Business-specific sections
## Recommended layout variations
## Form field requirements
## Sample placeholder content
## Special functionality notes

## Example Output When Requested:
'Generate a salon website with:

- Service list with duration/pricing
- Online booking (date/time picker)
- Stylist profiles section

- Pre-configured Netlify form with:
    - Name/email/phone
    - Service dropdown
    - Date/time selection
- Gallery grid layout
- Mobile-friendly navigation...'

Wait for my business type specification before generating the detailed prompt. Provide only this framework initially."
